# Galaxy Animation with p5.js

## Project Description

This project is an interactive 3D animation created using the p5.js library. It simulates a journey through space, featuring a dynamic starfield, drifting asteroids, distant colorful nebulae, and a spaceship model flying towards the viewer. The animation includes background music and allows the user to control the speed of the starfield using their mouse.

## Technology Used

*   **Framework/Library:** p5.js (including p5.sound for audio and WebGL for 3D rendering)
*   **Language:** JavaScript
*   **3D Model:** "E 45 Aircraft" by Dennis Haupt (3DHaupt) from Free3D
*   **Music:** "Space Ambient" by DELOSound from Pixabay

## How to Use

### Running Locally

1.  Ensure you have a local web server set up (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or Node.js `http-server`).
2.  Place all project files (`index.html`, `sketch.js`, `galaxy_music.mp3`, and the `E-45-Aircraft` folder containing the model and texture) in the same directory.
3.  Start your local web server in that directory.
4.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

### Interaction

1.  **Start:** Click anywhere on the screen to start the animation and the background music.
2.  **Control Speed:** Move your mouse horizontally across the screen. Moving the mouse to the right increases the speed of the starfield and asteroids, simulating faster travel. Moving it to the left decreases the speed.
